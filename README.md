# manager
An application to manage employees using Redux and React Native

This application is an application used for managing employees at any given company. The idea here is that a manager, or user, creates an acount or logs in,
views a list of current employees, adds employees if needed and edits current employees. 

Some important aspects to consider are: 
1. My use of redux throughout the whole application for state management.
2. firebase for authenication and noSQL database storage.
3. async calls using redux thunk for firebase calls.
4. ultilization of React-Native-Router-Flux to navigate between scenes. 
5. Iterating a flatlist view
